            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Train Rex Platform</h3>
            <p className="mb-6">
                <span className="font-semibold">a) Train Rex Platform:</span> The Train Rex platform enables consumers to purchase a monthly subscription to [*]. <br/><br/>
                <span className="font-semibold">b) Membership Options:</span> There are a number of ways to participate in Train Rex, such as various subscription plans. These options consist of different subscription packages, services and features and may be subject to additional and differing conditions, prices, policies and limitations. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered options and plans at any time in our discretion. Train Rex makes no commitment on the quantity, availability, type or frequency at which such Services, services, content and features will be available to non-subscribers and may modify, discontinue, remove or suspend access at any time and for any reason in our sole discretion. <br/><br/>
                <span className="font-semibold">c) Subscription Plans:</span> To enjoy full access to the Platform and Services, you need to sign up for a subscription. A subscription starts on the date that you sign up for a subscription and submit payment via a valid Payment Method (defined below) or reactivate a pre-existing subscription. Unless we otherwise communicate a different time period to you at the time of sign up or otherwise (such as a multi-month commitment plan), each billing cycle is one month in length (a “Subscription Cycle”). Your Train Rex subscription automatically renews each month, and we will automatically bill the monthly subscription fee to your Payment Method each month, until your subscription is cancelled or terminated. You must provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment (“Payment Method”). We may update the accepted methods from time to time. If you add a subscription to your base subscription or if you upgrade or downgrade to a different subscription, all such subscriptions will be governed by these Terms and will continue indefinitely until cancelled or terminated.<br/><br/>
                <span className="font-semibold">d) Use of Allocated Services:</span> Depending on the subscription plan you choose and purchase, you will be allotted Services to be used solely to book Services each Subscription Cycle. You can choose how you use your Services across the various Services available to you. Services expire at the end of each Subscription Cycle, meaning that any Services you don’t use during the applicable Subscription Cycle will not roll over into future months. You can find more information about the current rollover policies. You can see how many days you have left in each Subscription Cycle in your account settings. There will be no refund or payment for any unused amount. When your cycle automatically renews for the next month, you’ll automatically receive your new allotment of Services. If you have any questions about how to use your Services, please contact us and we can help you.<br/><br/> Services have no cash value or any other value outside of the Train Rex platform and are not redeemable for cash. For avoidance of doubt, the Services do not operate or serve as stored value facilities in any way. You may not transfer, trade, gift or otherwise exchange Train Rex Services.<br/><br/>
                <span className="font-semibold">e) Services Availability and Allocation:</span> The exact number and type of Services you get during any Subscription Cycle will depend on the subscription package you choose. Our partnered venues will allocate a chosen amount of time slots for the users of the Platform and Services, all allocated time slots and availability will be within booking page on the Train Rex app.<br/><br/> Train Rex does not guarantee the availability of particular venues, locations, services, experiences, content, inventory, spots or other features, and availability may change over time and at any time (including during the course of any given Subscription Cycle). The type, quantity, Services, allocation and availability of venues and other inventory offered, are determined by Train Rex in its sole discretion. Train Rex takes certain steps to release, promote and otherwise make available spots and inventory at varying times and in an ongoing and evolving way.<br/><br/>
                <span className="font-semibold">f) Non-Subscription Packages:</span> Train Rex has a free package that allows users access to  Train Rex AI chatbot. You acknowledge and agree that these Terms apply to any such purchase you make, and you will be responsible to pay the applicable fees, which may change at any time.<br/><br/>
                <span className="font-semibold">g) Use of Train Rex:</span> Your Train Rex account is personal to you and you agree not to create more than one account. You cannot transfer or gift Services to third parties or allow third parties to use your Train Rex account, including other Train Rex users. You must not use or exploit the Platform and/or Services for commercial purposes. To use your Train Rex membership you must have access to the Internet.

When you sign up, you will be asked to create a password. You are solely responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, including any activity by unauthorized users.

Unless we expressly communicated otherwise, your subscription will automatically renew each month and you will be billed on the same date each month (being the date on which you signed up), provided that, where such date does not exist in particular renewal month, your subscription will be deemed to auto-renew on the day immediately following the date of expiry of your current membership cycle. All membership auto-renews will continue to take place on the new auto-renew date (i.e., in this example, the 1st of each month). Payment will be taken on the effective date of your auto-renew (a “Renewal Date”), provided that, if we are unable for any reason to take payment on a Renewal Date, we will take payment as soon as practically possible thereafter.<br/><br/>

This may result in a change to your payment billing dates.
